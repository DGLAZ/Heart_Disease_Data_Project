In today's data-driven world, the ability to analyze and interpret data is crucial for making informed decisions. My recent project on predicting heart disease using machine learning models is a testament to the power of data analytics.

I began by loading and exploring the heart disease dataset, identifying missing values, and understanding the distributions and relationships between variables. Data cleaning was a critical step, where i filled missing values and removed duplicates to ensure the accuracy and reliability of my analysis.

Visualization played a significant role in my project. By using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib, i was able to
visualize the distribution of numerical and categorical variables, uncovering patterns and trends that guided the analysis. I also explored the relationship between exercise habits and alcohol consumption, providing valuable insights into lifestyle factors affecting heart health.

The core of this project was the machine learning models. Where i trained multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors. By evaluating and comparing their performance using metrics like accuracy, mean squared error, and r2-score, i was able to identify the best model for predicting heart disease.

This project highlights the importance of a structured approach to data analysis and machine learning. By following these steps, data analysts can ensure that their models are accurate, reliable, and provide valuable insights. Visualization and evaluation metrics help in making informed decisions and communicating results effectively.

This project not only showcases the technical skills required for data analysis but also emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare. By leveraging data analytics, we can make significant strides in predicting and preventing heart disease, ultimately saving lives.
